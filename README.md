## Objective

The objective of this project was to produce an application consisting of four microservices, which interact with one another to generate objects using some defined logic. Service one will render templates and communicate with the 3 other services. Both services two and three will generate random objects; service four will also create an object- based on the objects generated from services two and three. 

The following constraints for this project were also set: 

* Kanban Board: Trello Board for project tracking
* Version Control: Git - using the feature-branch model
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX
